ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ray Hsiao, a first-year computer science student at UCLA!


I like video games, and here are some I've worked on!
* Marketing and comic artist for [The Space in Between](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430240/The_Space_in_Between/), a romance visual novel exploring Chinese-American identity and mental health through stories in the stars
* Artist for [Ramen for Two](https://volcanogirl.itch.io/ramen-for-two), a visual novel developed for a 48 hour game jam with the theme "PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE"
* Artist for [Anything for You](https://volcanogirl.itch.io/anything-for-you), a wholesome point-and-click narrative game made for Ludum Dare 47
* Artist for [You Again](https://str0nkyk0ng.itch.io/you-again), a pixel side-scroller developed for the Berklee Game Music Jam

You can learn more about my interests on this little [interactive site](https://rh5140.github.io/star-site/) I made!
