ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ray Hsiao, a second-year computer science student at UCLA! I'm an officer for [ACM Game Studio](https://uclaacmstudio.itch.io/) and play viola in the [Game Music Ensemble](http://gmeatucla.com/).


Clearly, I like video games, and here are some I've worked on!
* Co-lead, artist, and composer for [mundaydreaming](https://aaisara12.itch.io/mundaydreaming), a side-scroller about a bored office worker who fantasizes about battling dragons developed for Ludum Dare 49
* Programmer and writer for [Cranky](https://brandmuffin.itch.io/cranky), a walking simulator about an old man who just wants some peace in his neighborhood
* Artist and character designer for [I Need a Hero!](https://zlc122.itch.io/i-need-a-hero-a-super-powered-dating-adventure), a superhero dating sim
* Marketing and comic artist for [The Space in Between](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430240/The_Space_in_Between/), a romance visual novel exploring Chinese-American identity and mental health through stories in the stars
* Artist for [Ramen for Two](https://volcanogirl.itch.io/ramen-for-two), a visual novel developed for a 48 hour game jam with the theme "PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE"
* Artist for [Anything for You](https://volcanogirl.itch.io/anything-for-you), a wholesome point-and-click narrative game made for Ludum Dare 47
* Artist for [You Again](https://str0nkyk0ng.itch.io/you-again), a pixel side-scroller developed for the Berklee Game Music Jam

All the games I've worked on can be found on [my Itch profile](https://raddishradish.itch.io/).
